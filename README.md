# Rewe Shop (basket emptier) Chrome Extension
This Chrome extension adds a button to the browser which allows emptying a shopping basket entirely on Rewe's Online Shop website.

rewe-shop-chrome-extension is a little fun project that I've developed to add missing functionality to Rewe's online shop.

## Installation
This extension has not yet been submitted to Chrome's store as it's intended as a fun project. However, if interested, it could be installed by manually loading the source code in Chrome's extensions. Settings > Extensions > Load Unpacked, and from here browse for the location of the source code.
